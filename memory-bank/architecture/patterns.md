# Architecture Patterns: Chefs

## Design Principles

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Additional Principles
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Favor simplicity over complexity
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't build features until needed
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate different aspects of functionality
